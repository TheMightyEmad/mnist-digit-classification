# Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition based on the MNIST dataset. The goal of this competition is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Model Architecture
The model used for this competition is a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented using the Keras framework with TensorFlow backend. The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and dense layers, along with max pooling and dropout regularization. The specific layer configurations and activations are designed to extract meaningful features from the input images and enable accurate digit classification.

## Data Augmentation
To enhance the model's performance and generalization, data augmentation techniques are applied. The Keras `ImageDataGenerator` class is utilized to perform random rotations, shifts, and zooms on the training images, along with nearest pixel filling. This helps to create a more diverse and robust training set.

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Early stopping is implemented using the `EarlyStopping` callback to prevent overfitting and improve efficiency. The training and validation accuracy are monitored during the training process to assess the model's performance.

## Results
The trained model achieves a competitive accuracy of approximately 99.3% on the test dataset provided by Kaggle. This indicates its ability to accurately classify handwritten digits. Please note that the performance may vary depending on the specific run and hardware configuration.

## Usage
To run this notebook:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) and place it in the same directory as this notebook.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file (if you're not running the code on cloud).
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to train the model and make predictions.
